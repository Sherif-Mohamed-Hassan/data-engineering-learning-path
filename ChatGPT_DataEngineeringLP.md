Got it â€” Iâ€™ll make your **6-month Data Engineering learning plan into a Trello/Kanban-ready format** so you can just copy-paste it into Trello and start tracking.

Iâ€™ll structure it with **Lists = Months**, **Cards = Weeks**, and **Checklists = Tasks/Resources/Projects**.

If you want, I can **also prepare this as a downloadable Trello board JSON** so you can **import it directly into Trello** with all lists, cards, and checklists pre-filled â€” no manual copy-paste.

Do you want me to make that Trello import file for you? That way you can have the entire plan ready in one click.
